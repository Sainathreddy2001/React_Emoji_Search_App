# React_Emoji_Search_App
Emoji Search app is created using React Beginner friendly Project. It uses a  vast array of emojies in local .json file. Users can search particular emoji and can copy to clipboard by clicking it. Used Bootstrap Cards for styling and useState, useEffect Hooks are used. Very good Project to practice on useEffect and useState Hooks in react.
